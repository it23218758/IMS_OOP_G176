  By default, no user is included in the "manager-gui" role required
  to operate the "/manager/html" web application.  If you wish to use this app,
  you must define such a user - the username and password are arbitrary.

  Built-in Tomcat manager roles:
    - manager-gui    - allows access to the HTML GUI and the status pages
    - manager-script - allows access to the HTTP API and the status pages
    - manager-jmx    - allows access to the JMX proxy and the status pages
    - manager-status - allows access to the status pages only

  The users below are wrapped in a comment and are therefore ignored. If you
  wish to configure one or more of these users for use with the manager web
  application, do not forget to remove the <!.. ..> that surrounds them. You
  will also need to set the passwords to something appropriate.
-->

  <user username="admin" password=admin" roles="manager-gui"/>
  <user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-script"/>


  <role rolename="tomcat"/>
  <role rolename="role1"/>
  <user username="admin" password="admin" roles="tomcat"/>
  <user username="admin" password="admin" roles="tomcat,role1"/>
  <user username="admin" password="admin" roles="role1"/>

</tomcat-users>
